  <h3 align="center">Core API - Oracle DB</h3>

## About The Project
Suppose, you're tasked with developing an application for your company or client, and part of the project involves accessing information from a third-party application that utilizes an Oracle database. In this scenario, you are only granted read permission to their database, and data security is of utmost importance. 

To address this requirement, We have wisely implemented the Repository Pattern in this application, ensuring both data access and security. The Secure Oracle Data Fetcher application serves as a crucial bridge between your organization and third-party applications relying on Oracle databases.
